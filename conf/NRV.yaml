forecasts:
# Currently canonical forecasts do not complete in 2 hour alotted time
    - canonical_forecasts  # canonical forecasts = close to operations, including extra components
    - standalone_forecasts  # standalone forecasts = "pure" toy models forecasts without any extra component (DFI, IAU, Fullpos...)

assim:
    - BSM_4D_arpege  # BSM = Bator+Screening+Minim
    - BSM_3D_arome  # BSM = Bator+Screening+Minim
    - BsC_arpege  # BsC = Bator_surf+Canari

# mixs: jobs containing several tasks of various families
mixs:
# Prep steps fail to compare SFX.SEAICE_SCHEM properly - no sense in running a forecast without the prep
    - PF  # Prep-Forecast (using older PGD)
# Prep steps fail to compare SFX.SEAICE_SCHEM properly - These cases only test PGD creation
    - PPF  # PGD-Prep-Forecast (using new PGD)

objects:
    - Bmat_arpege  # Construction and reading of a B-matrix using an ensemble, EnVar unit tests
# OOPS based expert (OOPSmodelADExpert) can't be found - no sense to test
#    - ModelTL_arpege # TL model, adjoint test

fullpos:
    - Fp_lbc  # Fp_lbc = Fullpos creation of LBC files

surfex:
    - PP_geo  # PP_geo = PGD+Prep on a range of Gauss & LAM geometries
